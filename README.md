# BMI_Calculator
For our school assignment, we developed a BMI Calculator designed to process patient information, such as height (in inches), weight, and age, and use this data to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI). The project utilizes three classes:

MyHealthDataTest: This is the main class that orchestrates the functioning of the application.
MyHealthData: Extends MyHealthDataBase. This class is responsible for storing patient information.
MyHealthDataBase: The core class where all the calculations happen. In addition to calculating the BMI, it also computes and returns the patient's target heart rate.
Each class plays a specific role in the functioning of the BMI Calculator, ensuring efficient handling and processing of patient health data.
